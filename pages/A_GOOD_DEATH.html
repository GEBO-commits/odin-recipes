            <h1>A GOOD DEATH</h1>
            <h4>THE last chapter</h4>
            <p>The Golden Round was filled to the brim with a sea of twinkling eyes, all glittering in excitement at the velvet curtain. The king sat in the theater with the queen and their advisers, all eagerly awaiting the onset of the dramatics. Everyone hushed as the black curtain lifted to reveal the actors.</p>

            <p>Magga sat in a quiet dressing room under the stage. She heard the crowd fall silent as she studied herself in the mirror. The luster of youth had faded from her eyes years ago, and left her with a long shock of silver running through her hair.</p>

            <p>“Madame!” said the stagehand. “You’re not in costume yet.”</p>

            <p>“No, child,” Magga said, “I only dress at the last moment.”</p>

            <p>“It is the last moment,” said the young stagehand, holding the two final pieces of Magga's costume: the same Lamb and Wolf masks from her days with the Orphellum Mechanicals.</p>

            <p>“May your performance be blessed tonight,” the stagehand said.</p>


            <p>Magga prepared to leave for the stage. She slipped the masks over her head. The old chill from the dark barrow crept down her spine. She welcomed it—as always.</p>

            <p>She enthralled the audience as she glided onto the stage, embodying Lamb's graceful movements. She thrilled the crowd with her rendition of Wolf's playful savagery. She, as the twin deaths personified, eased the suffering of her fellow actors, or ripped it from their throats, until the crowd stood on its feet and erupted in thunderous applause.</p>

            <p>It was true. All audiences loved a good death, and they loved Magga's more than any other.</p>

            <p>Even the king and queen were on their feet in praise of her work.</p>

            <p>But Magga heard no applause and saw no ovations. She didn't feel the stage beneath her feet, nor the hands of her fellow mummers in hers as they bowed low. All she felt was a sharp pain in her chest.</p>

            <p>When Magga looked out over the audience, every single face was either a lamb or a wolf.</p>
